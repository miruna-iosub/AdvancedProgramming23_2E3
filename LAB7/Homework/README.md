[x] Homework

[x] - Implement the commands that start/pause the robots (all of them or only a specific one). A robot can be paused for a specific time or indefinitely, requiring a start command. The commands must be given using the keyboard.
[x] - Design an algorithm such that each robots will try to explore the map in a systematic fashion, ensuring the termination of the exploration process.
[x] - Implement a timekeeper thread that runs concurrently with the player threads, as a daemon. This thread will display the running time of the exploration and it will stop it exceeds a certain time limit.
[x] - At the end of the exploration, determine how many tokens each robot has placed in the matrix.
