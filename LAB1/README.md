Homework 

- First I read from the keyboard an integer (n) using Java Scanner, and checked if it is a positive number

- Then I initialised the running time of the application in milliseconds (long startTime = System.nanoTime();)

- I created the latinSquare matrix containing symbols from 1 to n using the formula: (i + j) % n + 1;

- Using if condition I checked if the number is bigger than 30.000, if so, I just displayed the running time

- If the number is less than 30.000, I showed on the screen the matrix resulted from creating latinSquare and the concatenation of all the symbols from each line and column at the same time
