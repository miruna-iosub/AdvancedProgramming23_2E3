- First I created Person and Company classes and then extended from Person the following two classes: Designer and Programmer;
- The most important class is actually Network class which contains all the nodes within a network, memorizing them all via a List;
- - checkImportance() method simply return a node's importance within a network by counting all the relationship it has either with another node that is an instance of Person class or Company class;
- - To print the network i used showNetwork() method that creates an ArrayList of all the nodes and sorts them all in order to display them on the screen in ascending order depending on their importance;
